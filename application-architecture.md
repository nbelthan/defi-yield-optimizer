# DeFi Yield Farming Application Architecture

## Overview
This application will be a React-based web application that leverages the DefiLlama API to provide yield farmers with comprehensive information about yield opportunities, risk assessments, and detailed onboarding instructions.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React (using create-react-app)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: React Context API and hooks
- **API Integration**: Axios for API requests
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts for performance charts
- **UI Components**: Custom components with accessibility in mind

## Core Components

### 1. API Service Layer
- **DefiLlamaService**: Handles all API calls to DefiLlama endpoints
- **CacheService**: Implements client-side caching to reduce API calls
- **DataTransformService**: Transforms API responses into application-friendly formats

### 2. State Management
- **YieldContext**: Manages global state for yield data
- **FilterContext**: Manages filter state across components
- **UserInputContext**: Manages user input like investment amount

### 3. UI Components
- **MainLayout**: Overall application layout
- **FilterPanel**: Contains all filtering options (prominently displayed)
- **YieldTable**: Displays yield opportunities in tabular format
- **YieldCard**: Alternative card view for yield opportunities
- **RiskIndicator**: Visual representation of risk levels
- **PerformanceChart**: Historical APY and TVL visualization
- **CapitalImpactAnalysis**: Shows impact of user's capital on pool

### 4. Filter Components
- **InvestmentInput**: For entering planned investment amount
- **BlockchainSelector**: Multi-select dropdown for blockchains
- **ProtocolSelector**: Multi-select dropdown for protocols
- **AssetTypeFilter**: Toggle buttons for asset types
- **APYRangeSlider**: For setting min/max APY
- **TVLRangeSlider**: For setting min/max TVL
- **RiskLevelSelector**: Checkboxes for risk levels
- **RewardTokenFilter**: For filtering by reward tokens
- **CapitalCompatibilityFilter**: For filtering based on investment amount
- **TokenSearchField**: For searching specific tokens
- **SortOptions**: Dropdown for sorting results

### 5. LLM Integration
- **OnboardingExplanationService**: Handles communication with LLM
- **OnboardingFlowDisplay**: Renders the step-by-step explanation

## Data Flow
1. User inputs investment amount and applies filters
2. Application fetches data from DefiLlama API
3. Data is transformed and filtered based on user criteria
4. Risk assessment is applied to each yield opportunity
5. Results are displayed in sortable table/cards
6. User selects a yield opportunity
7. LLM generates detailed onboarding flow explanation
8. Explanation is displayed to user

## Risk Assessment System
- Combines multiple factors:
  - Impermanent Loss risk from API
  - Protocol reputation analysis
  - Asset volatility consideration
  - Capital impact calculation
- Produces a standardized risk grade for each opportunity

## Responsive Design
- All filters visible on desktop layouts
- Collapsible filter sections on tablet/mobile
- Maintains core functionality across all device sizes

## Performance Considerations
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Use client-side caching to reduce API calls
- Optimize rendering of large data tables
- Lazy load components when appropriate
